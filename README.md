# RoboVikes Practice Robot Code

This code is what is run on the practice robot, due to it having slightly different motor controllers than the Competition Robot.
Their should only be subtle differences, such as specific values(PID, motor speeds, etc.). In addition, the drive motors will be Victors instead of Talons as they are on the Competition robot.

# How to commit/push to this repository

  There are multiple branches in this repository. When trying to commit new code to this repository, make sure you commit and push to a branch other than the master branch first, there should be a branch relating to what you are attempting to finish with that code(development, vision processing, etc). When you are ready and confident that your code is ready for the master branch, make a merge request for the master branch and someone will have to approve your merge request. This secondary approval is required so that no buggy code makes its way into the master branch.
