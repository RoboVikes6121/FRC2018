# RoboVikes Practice Robot Code

This code is what is run on the practice robot, due to it having slightly different motor controllers than the Competition Robot.
Their should only be subtle differences, such as specific values(PID, motor speeds, etc.). In addition, the drive motors will be Victors instead of Talons as they are on the Competition robot.
