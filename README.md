# How to commit/push to this repository

  There are multiple branches in this repository. When trying to commit new code to this repository, make sure you commit and push to a branch other than the master branch first, there should be a branch relating to what you are attempting to finish with that code(development, vision processing, etc). When you are ready and confident that your code is ready for the master branch, make a merge request for the master branch and someone will have to approve your merge request. This secondary approval is required so that no buggy code makes its way into the master branch.
